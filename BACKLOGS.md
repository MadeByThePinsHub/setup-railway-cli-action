# Feature Backlog

## On Stable

* Installing Railway CLI through the official install script/npm package
* Importing Railway CLI binary to PATH
* Handling and parsing workflow options

## Currently Under Development / Needs Testing

* Building from source (especially if you're working on an PR for the CLI repo)

## Cobtributors Needed

* Windows Support (because the install script don't like Windows) - we need to handle User Account Control chaos
* Tests (in Jest) - real-time tests is being ran on my private repo and some repos in the future.

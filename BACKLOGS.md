# Feature Backlog

## On Stable

* Installing Railway CLI through the official install script/npm package
* Importing Railway CLI binary to PATH
* Handling and parsing workflow options

## Currently Under Development / Needs Testing

* Building from source (especially if you're working on an PR for the CLI repo)
* Installing Railway CLI through other means:
  * Homebrew/Linuxbrew
  * Any other supported package managers for Railway.

## Contributors Needed

* Windows Support (because the install script don't like Windows) - we need to handle User Account Control chaos
* Tests (in Jest) - real-life usage, manual tests is being ran on [this repo](https://github.com/AndreiJirohHaliliDev2006/solid-carnival) and some repos (including [our fork of Kutt](https://github.com/MadeByThePinsHub/rtappdotio)) in the future.

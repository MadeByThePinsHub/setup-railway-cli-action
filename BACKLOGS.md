# Feature Backlog

## Currently Writing

* Installing Railway CLI through the official install script/npm package
* Importing Railway CLI binary to PATH
* Building from source (especially if you're working on an PR for the CLI repo)
* Handling and parsing workflow options

## Cobtributors Needed

* Windows Support (because the install script don't like Windows) - as an workaround, install through NPM.
